# Supervised-Machine-Learning

## These are my solutions to the Practice Lab Assignments of the Machine Learning Specialization by Dr. Andrew Ng that I completed in November 2023.

The Machine Learning Specialization is divided into three courses:

1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
2. Learning Advanced Algorithms
3. Unsupervised Machine Learning: Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
   
I previously took a [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Q59MRA2HM5PL) course by Dr. Ng, but it was taught using Octave. However, given the increasing dominance of Python in the AI and other digital systems domains, I find it essential to adapt. As AI inevitably becomes an integral part of our society, I am upskilling and reskilling through self-study and online courses. Drawing upon the knowledge acquired from experts like the renowned AI pioneer, Dr. Ng, I strive not only to enhance my own understanding but also to share these learning materials with others.

Since I am a CEO and primarily delegate programming tasks to our tech team, this repo also serves as my reviewer whenever I need it.
