# Supervised-Machine-Learning

## These are my solutions to the Practice Lab Assignments of the Machine Learning Specialization by Dr. Andrew Ng that I completed in November 2023.

The [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/DXLGWH7YFGKH) is divided into three courses:  <br>

Course 1 (C1):  Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification   <br>
Course 2 (C2): Learning Advanced Algorithms   
Course 3 (C3): Unsupervised Machine Learning: Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning 
   
I previously took a [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Q59MRA2HM5PL) course by Dr. Ng, but it was taught using Octave. However, given the increasing dominance of Python in the AI and other digital systems domains, I find it essential to adapt. As AI inevitably becomes an integral part of our society, I am upskilling and reskilling through self-study and online courses. Gaining valuable knowledge from experts like the renowned AI pioneer, Dr. Ng, I strive not only to enhance my own understanding and skills but also to share these learning materials with others.

As a CEO whose main focus is growing the company and leading the team to the North Star, I primarily delegate programming tasks to our tech team. Hence, this repository also serves as my reviewer whenever I need to revisit my technical skills.

*Please note that, although, I have put MIT license, but some or most codes are provided solution readily by the team running the courses, especially the file with "_Soln" in it.*
